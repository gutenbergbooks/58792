</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Irony</span> is for the ironic. He has
shown himself military at the last,
but I believe Anatole France would
have smiled, a little wistfully, if told that a
young man had sentenced himself to read
every one of his works and to write a book
about them while there raged round him a
European War. Such an atmosphere may
seem unpropitious, but it was not really so;
it was an atmosphere of paradox; it was
odd to analyse the great pacifist while
Europe writhed in conflict; still odder to
think of him as throwing aside his pen and
at the age of seventy taking up his forsworn
sword. But in the case of Anatole France
the work is as great as the man and it
afforded me a contrast with patriotism.
This background of patriotism, so queerly
compounded of beer, sweat, fine courage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
self-sacrifice, self-interest, of insane prejudices,
heavy ignorances and melting
heroisms, was so exactly what I needed
to bring out the dapper quality of the
great Frenchman’s thought. No muddled
impulses here, but a clear, cold light which
reveals, together with all that is beautiful,
all that is ugly; here a brain that is without
illusions, and yet without bitterness; that
is not taken in by flags, and priests, and
frontiers, yet at the same time can love
priests for their faith, flags for their symbolism,
frontiers for the contrasts they create
in man. In <i>On Life and Letters</i>, Anatole
France tells us that during the war of 1870
he sat practically under the fire of the
German guns, with M. F. Calmette, reading
Virgil. I did not write these lines under
the fire of the German guns but, in the hectic
atmosphere of war-time, to write about
Anatole France created in me no doubt
much the same kind of feeling as was his
that day.</p>

<p>I do not apologise for the egotism which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
is already invading this monograph, and I
suppose I shall remain egotistic as I go on.
For the works of Anatole France are too
bulky, too many to be appraised one by one;
they raise so many issues that a fat quarto
volume would hardly suffice to analyse all,
and it would be rather dull. Believing that
criticism is “the adventures of the soul
among masterpieces,” I am much more inclined
to give the adventures of my intellect
(claiming no soul) among the works of
Anatole France. I have read very little
about him, indeed but one book, by Mr
Georg Brandes, and in the early part of 1914
a number of articles when Anatole France
paid us a visit. They are very distressing,
those articles, as they appear to have been
written mainly by men who do not know
what they are talking about, but can talk
about it exactly to the extent of a column.
I refer to the alleged evolution of Anatole
France, of which something must be said a
little further on.</p>

<p>The temptation to translate long quotations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
was very great, for translation is a
challenging exercise and an uneasy, but, so
far as possible, I have resisted it. I think
it only fair to say that, as a rule, I have
not translated very closely, but attempted
to render selected passages, fitting the style
to the matter; that is, for philosophic or
descriptive passages I have, as much as
possible, used Latinised English; for the
more familiar portions I have drawn upon
our slender stock of Anglo-Saxon.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> As for
the classifications, Anatole France satirist,
critic, politician, philosopher, etc., they are
necessarily rather rough; they overlap because
not one of his books is one thing,
and one thing only. In that direction too
I must claim the reader’s indulgence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>I should like to say in this respect that I am
greatly indebted to Mr John Lane, who owns the
British copyright of most of the works of Anatole
France, for leave not only to quote portions of his
translations, but also to retranslate and condense the
French text. A full list of the English titles of the
works will be found at the end of this volume.</p></div>

<p>Yet another word: I come neither to bury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Anatole France nor to praise him; there is
in one-man criticism a danger that it should
be too favourable, for the critic tends to
choose as a subject an author whom he
whole-heartedly worships. Now I do not
worship Anatole France; I have had to
read every one of his works over again in
the last few weeks, and if there is anything
calculated to make one hate a writer
for evermore it is to read all his works
one after the other. People are afraid
to criticise Anatole France adversely; he
seems to have attained the position now
accorded to Galileo (who was tortured), to
Joan of Arc (who was burned), to Wagner
(who was hooted), to everybody, in fact, who
ever did anything worth while. In his
early years, when de Maupassant, Zola,
Daudet, were alive, he was ignored; everything
was done to keep him down: the
Académie Française went so far as to give
him a prize. But times have changed;
Anatole France is acclaimed all over the
world; everybody quotes him, and those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
who cannot quote him quote his name;
he is above criticism. This would be very
bad for him if he were not also above adulation.
People dare not say the things which
should be obvious: that he repeats himself;
that he is sentimental; that his novels
are, from the point of view of French technique,
incoherent; that, as expressed by his
characters, his conception of love is rather
disgusting; in fact, they take all the
humanity out of him by endowing him with
all the graces; they erect to him a statue
which represents him just about as much as
the sort of statue they occasionally put up
to some highly respectable politician whom
they depict stark naked, and beautiful as
a young <em>discobolus</em>.</p>

<p>The reason probably is that it is not
enough to understand Anatole France;
one also has to understand the French, the
gay, sensual, garrulous French of the Middle
Ages, the gay, sensual, courteous French of
the seventeenth century, the gay, sensual,
cynical French of Voltairian times, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
sensual, cynical French of to-day. Anatole
France is all these, a sort of historical congress
of French epochs, a retrospective
exhibition of French mentalities. That
perhaps explains the confusion which reigns
in the minds of a great many people as to
his alleged evolution from reaction to red
socialism, a confusion so great that it seems
to have touched even Mr Georg Brandes.</p>

<p>It is not wonderful that Anatole France
should be so representative, for he is a provincial
by extraction, a Parisian by birth
and environment. The whole of his biography
is revealed in his books, so it is
enough to say that he was born in 1844, in
the Quarter (that was inevitable), that he
grew up in his father’s old bookshop near
the quays of the Seine, listening, as he grew
up, sometimes to the talk of republicans, for
those were the days of the Second Empire,
much more often to that of elegant half-worldling
abbés and aristocrats, for his father
was a pronounced Royalist and Catholic,
as was also his mother.... Old books,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
good talk, and the Seine lazily flowing under
the plane-trees before there were steam trams.
It is all very like Anatole France, like the
four volumes of <i>Contemporary History</i> where
the bookshop is the centre, like <i>Pierre
Nozière</i> and <i>My Friend’s Book</i>. Then
little France (whose real name is Thibault)
went to the Collège Stanislas to be brought
up as a good Royalist child. But he did not
do particularly well there, thus bearing out
the legend of the prize boy. Notably he
loafed. Anatole France in life has always
loafed, which is natural enough in one who
was born near bridges. Who would not loaf
who has a flowing river to watch? It might
be said that Anatole France has loafed
through thirty-five volumes.</p>

<p>As he grew up he accomplished desultory
tasks, he taught, he wrote articles for the
papers; in 1868 he published his study of
Alfred de Vigny; in 1873 and 1876 he
gave us two volumes of verse, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Poèmes Dorés</i>
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Noces Corinthiennes</i>. Not very
startling or attractive verse; however deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Anatole France’s poetic feeling, he has never
approached greatness as a poet, perhaps
because he was always too calm, too detached,
because so seldom did his eye in
fine frenzy roll. Only when at last, in
1879, he published his first work of creative
prose, two longish stories, <i>Jocasta</i> and <i>The
Famished Cat</i>, followed, two years later, by
<i>The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard</i>, and in
1882 by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Désirs de Jean Servien</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> was
born the Anatole France we know to-day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>The title is given in English if the work has been
translated, in French if it has not.</p></div>

<p>I cannot lay too much stress upon that.
Anatole France was potentially in 1881 what
he is now. It has continually been suggested
that, up to 1898 and the revival
of the Dreyfus case, Anatole France was
a reactionary, a clerical, an anti-democrat;
that, somehow, in an unexplained manner,
he underwent a change of heart and suddenly
turned into a humanitarian socialist; and
a few bold folk hinted, when <i>The Gods
are Athirst</i> appeared in 1913, that Anatole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
France, because he painted a dreadful and
therefore not over-kind picture of the
French Revolution, had reacted again.
Briefly: the genius as weathercock. It
has even been suggested that Anatole France
wrote this reactionary book to make his
peace with the respectable classes and to get
into the Académie Française: the answer
is that Anatole France was a member of that
august body seventeen years before the
publication of the book.</p>

<p>An examination of Anatole France’s early
works is vital to this question, notably of
<i>Jocasta</i>, which has very little to do with the
myth, for there is no Œdipus to murder his
father and marry his mother; Anatole
France is too modern for that. It is a queer,
horrible story of the daughter of a shady
middleman who, instead of marrying the
young doctor she loves, weds a wealthy
and sinister old Englishman, whom, to her
knowledge, his valet murders. Fearing discovery
and haunted by remorse (the Furies),
emulating Jocasta, she hangs herself. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
story would hardly be worth mentioning
save for its fine literary style and its high
characterisation of Fellaire, the solemn,
kindly, bumptious, sentimental middleman,
of Haviland, the dry and methodical collector,
if already here Anatole France were
not at the age of thirty-five indicating what
he would become. For he makes a journalist
say in conclusion, after discussing the
immortality of the soul and deciding that
it is really a very complicated question:
“Fortunately the Almighty is not a subject
for an up-to-date par.”</p>

<p>In the second story, <i>The Famished Cat</i>,
where again we have the quite magical
picture of Godet-Laterasse, the seedy revolutionary,
and of the absurd people concerned
with absurd arts at the Famished
Cat tavern, we find another incarnation of
the future Anatole France: the sculptor
Labanne, lazy, ironic, who moralises on art
rather as will Choulette in <i>The Red Lily</i>,
fifteen years later. But it is in <i>The Crime
of Sylvestre Bonnard</i> that Anatole France<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
most clearly indicates his own future. This
is just the straggling story of Bonnard, the
old professor, who observes the world, interested
in women, Benedictine chronicles,
the Arc de Triomphe, cats and the love
affairs of fourteenth-century queens. The
old gentleman watches over the granddaughter
of one whom he loved but never
married. He behaves quite quixotically,
protects her against a schoolmistress who
ill treats her; at last he kidnaps her to make
her happy, and all ends well in spite of a
little tragedy when the girl marries and old
Bonnard sells his books to give her a dowry.
It is all most incoherent, and one never
quite knows what Sylvestre Bonnard’s crime
was; it may be the abduction (for old
Bonnard, learned in the law of the sixth
century, knows nothing of the Code
Napoleon), or it may be, which is much more
likely, that when he sells his books there
are some he cannot bear to part with, even
to afford his ward a dowry, and that he goes
by night now and then to steal a few of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
from the pile. The whole story is full of
charm, and Mr Georg Brandes is unjust
when he describes it as a simple tale. It is
much more than that: it singularly reveals
Anatole France himself, for here we have
a man aged thirty-six writing as a kindly,
rather cynical, faintly ironic old gentleman,
fond of the classics and of humanity. Children
make him sentimental; he lectures his
cat on immortal truth. He says: “I have
always preferred the folly of passion to the
wisdom of indifference.” And that is true,
only one feels that he loves best the folly of
passion when it afflicts others. The book
ends on a melancholic note, which is perhaps
not so melancholic as it seems, for it brings
out life passing by, all golden and bloody,
as an old, old ship with a sumptuous figurehead,
with ragged silken sails, carrying the
embalmed corpses of those who first signed
on, and their own sons growing up, full of
sap, their thick hair streaming in the wind.
Already in this book Anatole France is gentle.
He is remorseful because “he has made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
fun of an unhappy man”; he is full of pity
for a beggar-boy who will not accept a bit
of gingerbread, and says: “He dares not
touch it: in virtue of precocious experience
he does not believe in happiness.” He states
a general theory: the time that God gives
each one of us is as a precious fabric which
we embroider as well as we may. This man
of thirty-six is already old; he has laid his
hand on the head of man as if he were a little
child, and said: “Creature that thinkest
to find eternity in the intensity of thy sufferings,
in their permanence, in the impossibility
of thy loves, and the greatness of thy
charms; oh, little creature on this blind
world, I, old man, old God, who have seen
so many worlds like this one busily spinning,
let me beg thee be not so urgent, so hot, so
young. For I am old, old as truth, and I
know the shortness of thy pains.”</p>

<p>Who is Sylvestre Bonnard? Sylvestre
Bonnard is Bergeret, is Coignard, is Brotteaux,
he is the first of all those nice old
gentlemen who pass through the pages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Anatole France. He has never changed;
he was born like a young rat in a book-case,
and so he remained. Those old gentlemen
believe in service, resignation; they are
tolerant and indulgent, and are always ready
to say when the time comes, to any God you
prefer, for they don’t mind: “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Et nunc
dimittis servum tuum, Domine</i>.”</p>

<p>The philosophical humanitarian who was
to defend Dreyfus existed, then, in 1881;
the subsidiary motives existed too in those
years. For instance, in <i>My Friend’s Book</i>
(1885) the small boy says: “I saw my
father, my mother and the maid as very
gentle giants who had witnessed the birth
of the world, immutable, everlasting, unique
of their kind.” That is exactly what the
little dog, Riquet, thinks of man in general
and what Anatole France perfidiously allows
us to conclude man has always thought of
God. Already he is cynical, and yet smiling,
for he says: “I have faith no longer in my
old friend, life: yet I still love it.” But
there is in this book a more important indication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
of the man to come; it is not only the
alleged Socialist of 1898 that already exists,
but the passionate pagan of 1914. In <i>My
Friend’s Book</i> he takes a little girl to a Punch
and Judy show. Punch kills the devil, and
Pierre Nozière (Anatole France) remarks:
“The devil dead, good-bye sin. Maybe
beauty, this ally of the devil, will vanish
with him. Maybe we shall not again see
the flowers that intoxicate and the eyes that
slay.” Any student of Anatole France will
realise that in 1885 the author was already
expressing what he would state more fully in
1914 in <i>The Revolt of the Angels</i>—namely, his
fear and hatred of ascetic, beauty-hating,
death-desirous Christianity.</p>

<p>And there is more: forgive me if I paint
the lily a little, but others have painted it and
in colours which displease me. The alleged
reactionary of <i>The Gods are Athirst</i>, the man
who was supposed to have gone back in
1914 upon the humanitarian and republican
sentiments of the Dreyfus period, that man
was, in 1882, in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Désirs de Jean Servien</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
(a thoroughly second-rate novelette), painting
an absurd revolutionary. The Commune
reigns; he shows the hero the people rioting
in the Luxembourg Gardens, and says:
“M. Servien, look upon this scene and never
forget it: here is a free people. <em>Indeed the
citizens were walking upon the grass, plucking
flowers in the beds, and breaking off the
branches of the trees.</em>” Anatole France had in
those days few illusions as to the behaviour
of free peoples! And again in the short
stories which make up <i>Mother of Pearl</i> (1892)
one is oppressed by Anatole France’s hatred
of the revolutionaries, their brute ignorance,
vanity, stupidity, their mean revengefulness,
and their silly imitation of Roman attitudes.</p>

<p>Anatole France is what he was, and if
he seems to have changed now and then, or
to have been inconsistent, it is because he
is a developed human being, a rare bird.
He has not cut out his views as with a
stencil; they are fluid, they overlap, and
he can hold simultaneously two entirely
divergent views. I submit that any man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
high intellectual development tends to hold
two views upon one topic. One view is that
of his instinct, the other is that of his reason.
In the case of Anatole France the instinct
is always hedonistic; he is a pagan; he
loves Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, and
even the Catholic Church, for their beauty;
he is fond of all the good things of the
world, beautiful women, flowers, sweetmeats;
of all the fine, disdainful aristocratic
ideas of the artists and the philosophers....
But there is what may be called his
social conscience, which is utilitarian and
Socialistic. That conscience tells him that
however much beauty he may extract
from it, this world, filled with wars, with
cruelties, with factories, with ugly houses
and ugly clothes, with mean prejudices,
is a world for which he is responsible
because he is a man. The dream of that
ugly world will not let him sleep easily upon
his rose-decked couch. There is the conflict
which has puzzled so many of his readers;
sometimes an Epicurean, at other times a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
sort of Lloyd Georgeite is apparent. This
does not mean that Anatole France is throwing
over any ideas; he is merely being more
or less influenced by one side of his own self.
His love of humanity has always made it
difficult for him to enjoy the fruit he raised
to his mouth if it occurred to him just then
that other mouths might go hungry.</p>

<span class="subhead">SATIRIST AND CRITIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> Anatole France is to be remembered—that
is, for a while, which is perhaps all
a man can hope—it will be as a critic
and as a satirist. Whether he will be remembered
longer than his contemporaries,
Tolstoy or Mr Shaw, I do not know.
Though he has delighted us, the race of
delights is short and pleasures have mutable
faces; he may share the fate of Flaubert,
who is menaced; of de Maupassant, who is
going; or of Schiller, forgotten; of Walter
Scott, reduced to a juvenile circulation; of
Thackeray, staking all upon one novel;
of Dickens, surviving by the picturesque; of
Tolstoy, convicted as a moralist; of Greeks
uneasily staggering under the burden of
illogical murder and absurd incest ... I
do not think that he will join the glorious
band: Homer, Shakespeare, Molière. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Anatole France has understood all things,
but mainly in their details. He has made
a mosaic, not a marble court; seated on
Olympus, his eyes have been too keen,
and he has seen men too clearly, man not
enough. But still he is, I suppose, assured
of his line in any biographical dictionary
that may be printed in the year 3000, and
that is a good deal. I like to think of that
entry in the <i>Cyclopædia of Literature</i> (published
by the International Government
Press; price, seven days labour bonds, net).
It runs something like this:</p>

<blockquote class="narrow hang">

<p><span class="smcap">France</span> (Anatole). Pen-name of Jacques
Anatole Thibault. French writer, b. 1844.
d.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. Satirist and critic. Some of his
work has merit as reflecting the faintly
enlightened views of an observer living in
barbarous times.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anatole France is the only living satirist.
He has actually no rivals; there are men
such as Messrs Max Beerbohm, Hansi,
Mirbeau, Hector Munro, F. P. Dunne, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
have a glimmering of what satire means;
Mr Wells would have more than a glimmering
if, unfortunately, he did not hold deep
convictions about right and wrong, a weakness
to which, in spite of all appearances,
Mr Shaw also succumbs; but Anatole
France alone upholds the ancient tradition
of Voltaire, of Defoe and Swift. His satire
is always effective because it is always
light, always pointed and always smiling.
He has none of the bitterness of Swift and
therefore he is the truer cynic, for true
cynicism is not fierce; it is always genial.
He never labours a point; he states, presents
the contrasts between, for instance,
what a rich man may do as opposed to a
poor one, and then passes on, laughing,
Pan-like dancing, with perhaps a tear or
two in his laughter.</p>

<p>Though almost every book he has written
is satirical in intent, or at least in incident,
five volumes are satire pure and
simple; as I have no space to analyse all
his works, these five representatives must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
expound him. They are <i>Penguin Island</i>
and the four volumes of <i>Contemporary
History</i> (<i>The Elm Tree on the Mall</i>, <i>The
Wickerwork Woman</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">L’Anneau d’Améthyste</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Monsieur Bergeret à Paris</i>). They overlap
a little, but the spirit which informs them
is different. <i>Penguin Island</i> is broad,
applicable to the whole history of man, while
the other four volumes cover rather the
modern irregularities of the French State.
For this reason, <i>Penguin Island</i> is a bigger
and a finer thing; indeed it is probably the
biggest thing Anatole France has done,
because, dealing as it does with the earliest
superstitions of man, his faith in gods and
in God, with the rise of feudalism, the roots
of democracy, war, the birth of art, the
action and reaction of parties, it has a sweep
so large that it envelops even ages now in
the womb of time. It is a terrible book,
not so much because it is the thinly veiled
history of the French people—that is to say,
the story of follies, miseries and crimes (the
story of any other imperial people)—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
because at the end Anatole France reaches
forth into the future. And what he sees is
a development of capitalism by the side of
which modern capitalism is as a puling child;
he summarises in a phrase a period of greater
New York: “the houses were never high
enough.” He sees the masses rising, revolution,
the break-up of the social system, the
return of pastoralism, man once more
nomadic ... towns forming ... another
aristocracy ... Parliaments ... industry
and capitalism fastening upon the world, and
again the houses never high enough....
That is a vision of horror, of a world unchanging,
unchangeable, of man as a dog ever
returning to his own vomit. I should like
to pursue the dream further, to the death
of the sun, when the earth shall grow
cold and a terrible term be brought to the
stupidity of man; he shall once more be a
fearful brute hiding in a cave, until at last,
upon his cold and dying globe, among
settling mists, he shall yield up the last spark
of a misused life....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Anatole France is certainly wrong, for no
barbarism which the world has ever known
ever was so barbarous as the barbarism
that went before. If the life of man describes
a curve, this is not a circle; he does
not interminably return to the same point;
rather the curve is a cycloid, ever bending
back upon itself and yet slowly moving onwards
towards the unknown goal. Anatole
France does not, I think, quite deny that,
but he is not over-fond of what he calls idle
speculation: where his knowledge stops he
is inclined to say: “After all, what does it
matter to Sirius?”</p>

<p>The island where the penguins lived was
evangelised by St Mael, who quite naïvely
relates how he navigated to its shores in a
stone trough. God served him as rudder
and sail. It would have been all right if the
saint had not been short-sighted, but he took
the penguins for men and baptized them,
which gave rise to great trouble in heaven
and a wonderful ecclesiastical debate. For
St Patrick said that baptism could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
avail birds; St Damasius said it could, for
Mael was competent; St Guenolé said it
could not, because penguins were not conceived
in sin; St Augustine thought it could
if given in proper form. This caused much
ill feeling in Paradise; Tertullian grew
quite vicious and said he was sorry that
the penguins had no soul, as thus they
could not go to hell. The intervention of
the Almighty was hailed with unanimous
cheers, which St Augustine backed up by
begging Him not to give the penguins a
soul because, as they could not keep the
law, they would burn in hell “in virtue of
God’s adorable decrees.” Upon this the
disturbance turned to scandal, and to end
it the penguins were turned into men.</p>

<p>Then the troubles of the once happy birds
began. They were clad and modesty was
born. Property arose, and murder. The
Catholic Devil had a hand in this and remarked
that the murderers were creating
rights, constituting property, laying the
bases of civilisation, of society and the State.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
He added that the source of property is
force. Later a state formed and the poor
only were taxed because they could not
resist, and because there were more of them.
A freebooter arose: he became a king. His
armies went to war and were beloved, for
they won. Art appeared; Margaritone
foresaw the decadence of ecclesiastical art
and, in a horrid dream, something like post-impressionism.
The priest, Marbode, visited
Virgil in hell; the Latin poet remarked that
Dante was rather a bore and that Christ was
the god of barbarism. Then history unrolls.
There is a revolution (obviously 1789);
Trinco (Napoleon) appears and a loyal penguin
states that glory cannot cost too much.
Modern times give Anatole France a yet
greater chance, for he takes us to New
Atlantis (America), where commercial wars
are executed on contract, because a business
people must have a policy of conquest; the
European War of 1914, if one dives deep
under the crust of patriotism, sounds very
like the war of New Atlantis against Third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Zealand “where they killed two-thirds of
the inhabitants to compel the remaining
third to buy from New Atlantis umbrellas
and braces.” Plutocracy. Socialism. Royalist
agitations, supported by the leaders of the
army, the wineshops, the newsboys, the
police and the courtesans. All through this
section runs the Pyrot case. A traitor
(Dreyfus) sold ninety thousand bundles of
hay to the foreigner—that is to say, he did
not sell them, for they did not exist. Yet
General Panther says: “Evidently Pyrot
stole them, so all we have to do is to prove
it.” To which another General replies:
“Arrest Pyrot. Find some evidence; the
law demands it.”</p>

<p>Then the agitation, difficult because the
people like to believe in guilt and are too
stupid to doubt. Still no evidence, and
evidence manufactured. Here Anatole
France puts into the General’s mouth
beautiful phrases: “Don’t have evidence;
it makes the case less clear”; and: “It may
be better to have no evidence, but still if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
you must have some, trumped-up evidence is
better than the truth, for it is made to order.”
And so on through popular agitations,
Royalist manœuvres, Boulangism, the
renaissance of Catholicism (supported by
Jewish money), political adultery, the rule
of gold, until we come to the time when
houses are never high enough....</p>

<p>This is not the satire of Englishmen. It
has not the truculence of Defoe’s <i>A Short
Way with Dissenters</i>; nor does it state the
author’s view as does any one of Mr Shaw’s
plays; nor is it so veiled as <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>.
All this is together elusive and obvious; it
aims at showing the reader what lies under
history, man in the soldier’s coat, his meanness,
his greed, his lust for power, and the
horrible, crusted stupidity to which alone
are traceable his crimes.</p>

<p>I should not advise any Englishman who
is not conversant with French history to
read <i>Penguin Island</i>, but I should not advise
any Englishman at all to read the four
volumes of <i>Contemporary History</i> unless he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
has lived in France for the last fifteen years
and mixed in every kind of French society.
He will find in those books droll stories, and
droll incidents; he will see that the author
is getting at something, but that is all. For
those volumes do not deal with the big outer
movements which one can watch from the
columns of <i>The Times</i>. They are concerned
with the mysteries inside French politics,
paralleled here by the “Confederates,” the
Marconi case, the theft of the crown jewels
at Dublin, the secret history of the rebellion
of the officers at the Curragh. No Frenchman
would understand a book dealing with
those things, so it is too much to expect an
Englishman to understand <i>Contemporary
History</i>. The circumstances that led to the
writing of these books are simple enough.
The Dreyfus case was used as a platform for
clerical, Royalist and militarist agitation.
The Government set to work to break the
Church and broke it (after which the Church
mended itself and became stronger than
ever); the Nationalist revival took place, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
since that time there has been much manœuvring,
some intended to restore the Bourbons
and quite ridiculous, some of it designed to
gain well-paid posts for reactionaries, and
that one much in earnest. The interesting
parts of the four books are the commentaries
of M. Bergeret, a university professor
in a little town, who, I need hardly say, is (just
like Sylvestre Bonnard, Coignard, Trublet,
Brotteaux) Anatole France himself. The
four books, published between 1897 and 1901,
more or less cover that period. In <i>The Elm
Tree on the Mall</i> unfolds, with local politics,
the life of Bergeret, married to a shrew, unloved
of his daughters, disliked by most
people because he thinks for himself, which
amounts to saying that he does not think
like anybody else. Round him eddy representative
characters, the Abbé Guitrel, who
wants to be a bishop and is proceeding towards
the episcopate half by apostolic mansuetude,
half by way of Ignatius of Loyola;
Worms-Clavelin, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">préfet</i> (chief of the local
executive), who is a Jew, a Freemason, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Conservative Catholic, an advanced Republican,
a Socialist, a Royalist and a few
other things necessary to the maintenance
of his post; his wife is friendly to Guitrel
because the Abbé makes her feel French (she
was born Noemi Coblenz) and because she
“likes to protect one of those tonsured
heads charged for eighteen centuries with
the excommunication and extermination of
the circumcised.” There is General de Chalmot,
a soldier, who thinks that if you
destroy belief you ruin the military spirit,
because you take away the hope of another
life; there is Paillot’s bookshop where
Bergeret meets the county, the lawyers, the
doctors, to talk of books, politics, actresses
and their figures....</p>

<p>Nothing in particular happens. Guitrel’s
bishopric is the leading string of the action;
there is Madame Worms-Clavelin helping
Guitrel, who finds her, at bargain prices,
chasubles with which she covers her armchairs;
there is a young girl, Claudine
Deniseau, who, inspired by St Radegunde,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
becomes a prophetess, indulges in healing,
predicts frost and the return of the king;
there is Worms-Clavelin, trying to keep the
prophetess quiet, because so ancient a person
as St Radegunde ought really not to cause a
row in a country town. An old lady of
eighty is murdered by her boy-lover, which
causes Bergeret to remark that murder is
quite natural and fortunate, for without evil
one could not see beauty. Worms-Clavelin
kisses Madame de Gromance on the shoulder,
(a local custom); a senator promotes
shady companies while his wife embroiders
altar-cloths; and somehow the story ends
with Guitrel very much out of the running
for the episcopal stakes.</p>

<p>What matters in the book is Bergeret,
sitting under the elm-tree on the Mall, or
in the bookshop, thinking, talking, smiling
at the comedy. Notable are his talks with
Lantaigne, another candidate for the bishopric,
and the type of the intellectual priest.
Anatole France may detest the Catholic
attitude, but he understands it admirably,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
and when Lantaigne contends that one can
have two opinions, one conscious and
rationalistic, the other intuitive and theological,
he makes a very fine case. For him,
in the case of Joshua, celestial astronomy is
not the astronomy of man, and in celestial
mathematics, 3 + 3 may make nine, because
we do not know all the properties of numbers.
At other times Bergeret, who talks to
anybody, tells the melancholic story of
Napoleon III., who never managed to grant
his foster-brother a small post in the civil
service: “The Emperor was a charming
fellow but, alas, he had no influence.” And
so the book wanders on with the opinions
of Bergeret, happy, like Æsop, in the
freedom of his mind, in spite of the narrowness
of his home, conscious that the State
is honoured so long as it taxes the poor, and
that the republic is easiest to live under
because it does not govern much, that revolutions
help none save the flourishing and
the ambitious. It would all be profoundly
pessimistic if it were not always genial.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
One feels sure that if Bergeret had an
agreeable wife, a good cook, and a volume
of Lucretius (Oh, Omar!), he would let the
State do just what it liked.</p>

<p>The story continues in <i>The Wickerwork
Woman</i>, with Bergeret working up his
lecture in the worst room in his flat, where
stands the wickerwork figure used for dress-making,
symbolic of his unpleasant wife.
He grumbles, and then considers the Romans.
“They were not heroes, they preferred
making roads, they only made war for
business reasons.” He thinks of soldiers
and wonders whether the sergeant has a
right to tell a conscript that his mother is a
sow: he decides that the sergeant has this
right, for without it there can be no hierarchy
or discipline. Then the cook gives notice,
and Guitrel goes to Paris while Bergeret
talks to a tramp who says that when he was
young he lost his pride because people made
fun of him....</p>

<p>The town is greatly upset because the
prophetess cannot give the logarithm of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
nine. (Another case of celestial mathematics?)
Madame de Gromance passes, and
Bergeret reflects that to see a pretty woman
is a stroke of luck for an honest man. He is
“grateful to her for dressing with art and
discretion.” But tragedy invades the
Bergeret household, for Roux, a pupil,
becomes the lover of Madame Bergeret ...
in circumstances which make it impossible
for the professor to doubt his eyes. After
a murderous moment Bergeret decides that
this is all really very trifling, throws the
wickerwork figure through the window, and
goes out to talk to Paillot, the bookseller;
he reflects vaguely on adultery and
its meaninglessness. Guitrel and the archdeacon
hold an earnest discussion on
omelettes. Inspired by Marcus Aurelius,
Bergeret concludes that the art of life
is a benevolent contempt for man: all
Anatole France is there. For him those
lovers were chimpanzees, and he feels a
little superior because he is “a meditative
chimpanzee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
The conversations continue to develop.
Fremont, inspector of fine arts, is “patriotic,
even in art”; Worms-Clavelin states that
he loathes the Empire, but adds: “Still
we make wine, grow corn, as under the emperor
... we work on the Stock Exchange,
eat, drink, make love as under the emperor.”
The upshot is: “Don’t touch the machine,
for it will be all the same whatever you do.”</p>

<p>The execution of the murderer of the old
lady enables Bergeret to state his views,
which are, as usual, exceedingly unpopular,
for he will not have it that the murderer was
a degenerate: had not Mithridates a double
row of teeth? Nor shall tattooing prove the
crime, for are not fashionable travellers
tattooed? And then he wanders off on the
fiction of the aristocratic type in woman,
which is entirely derived from the smart
shopgirl and the plebeian actress. The
shady senator is arrested, but released, says
his wife, owing to the intervention of the
Almighty. Meanwhile Bergeret refuses to
speak to his unfaithful wife, which causes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
great trouble in the house, because the cook,
disliking the goings-on, gives notice again;
the new cook can make only one kind of
soup, which is very annoying. And so the
book rambles on until Madame Bergeret,
unable to bear dumb disdain, leaves with her
two daughters.</p>

<p>Before leaving she has disgraced herself
again with Lacarelle, “the Gaul,” who only
made love to her because his moustache was
so long that this was expected of him. The
Dreyfus case is beginning to bubble, and
Guitrel, friendly to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">préfet</i>, finds it difficult
to defend the Jews, except “the converted
ones who have done a lot for the
Church by their wealth.” Long story of
Saint Austregisile, and of the Virgin’s
miraculous foot. Honorine, the visionary,
has a miraculous trance, and then retires into
a bush to make love to a tramp. Fat and
beautiful Madame de Bonmont entertains
Guitrel. History of the rise of this county
family, late Nathan, and of Madame de
Bonmont’s love-making with Raoul, duellist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
and gambler, illustrious because he fought a
Jew who had in a café asked for the Army
List and thereby outraged the French flag.
As the agitation progresses, the loyal populace
sacks the shop of Meyer, the bootmaker,
and retires, having struck a good blow for
their country. In these days Bergeret is
happy, talking to Riquet, his dog, “a religious
beast,” thinking and talking of Hercules,
whom he looks upon as a sort of boxer at a
fair, and of the history of Spain....</p>

<p>Little boys pass, shouting: “Down with
Zola!...”</p>

<p>Bergeret is a Dreyfusist. It does not
make him any more popular than he became
when he said that Joan of Arc was only a
military mascot. Bergeret wistfully begins
to desire Madame de Gromance, but knows
that he has no chance; so he returns to his
thoughts and to the all-pervading Dreyfus
case, realising that the crowd cannot reason,
that “it holds with established error.”
Young de Bonmont meanwhile sends his
beautiful mother to see a most glad-eyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Cabinet minister who has power to make
Guitrel a bishop, because if Guitrel is made
a bishop he can induce the local duke to
invite young de Bonmont to the hunt. One
is sorry for Madame de Bonmont, so fat
and so innocent, but one does not feel sorry
when young Dellion, who is for the time
being favoured of Madame de Gromance,
enlists her influence on the side of Guitrel,
and while she is putting on her stays discusses
the future of the bishopric. The
talk veers to fashions, and while she attaches
her suspenders Madame de Gromance argues
whether his mother, Madame Dellion, was
truly virtuous. Meanwhile Madame Worms-Clavelin,
also supporting Guitrel, makes—well,
let us say, great concessions to the
secretary of the Cabinet minister, in the cause
of chasubles at bargain prices and of good
government....</p>

<p>Bergeret continues to attack most things:
antisemitism, because he is not big enough to
hate ninety thousand people; nationality,
because there is no such thing, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
alleged French are only Gauls, Iberians,
Celts, Romans, Franks and Saracens.
Guitrel, made a bishop, is broken for attacking
the Government, while poor Madame de
Bonmont leaves her amethyst ring on
Raoul’s bedroom mantelpiece.</p>

<p>In the last volume, Bergeret, now a professor
in Paris, reflects on the quality of meat,
the soul of dogs, and the essence of heroism.
Panneton de la Barge delivers a passionate
speech on the army which is “the consolation
of the present and the hope of the
future,” and ends by enlisting Bergeret’s
influence to get his son out of two years’
military service. Madame de Bonmont has
now fallen into the arms of Lacrisse, secretary
of the Royalist group, for she wishes to
save France. Lacrisse’s chief occupation is
to coach generals in evidence to be used at
the Dreyfus trial. Conspiracy. A letter
from the Pretender; great sensation which
leads to the conquest of Lacrisse, for Madame
de Bonmont gives him “a historic embrace.”
He then compels her reluctantly to subscribe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
to the funds. Royalist fête. And Panneton
begins to cook the local elections with the
help of Madame de Gromance: he finds
that the one place where they can talk politics
is a flat furnished with a graduated series
of sofas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bergeret indulges in charity to
a beggar called Clopinel, and then remarks:
“I have done wrong, I have given alms ...
I have tasted the shameful joy of abasing
my fellow-man, I have signed the odious
pact which preserves strength for the
strong, weakness for the weak. I have
sold to my brother fraternity at short
weight.... I have been tempted. Oh,
seducer! Oh dangerous Clopinel! Delicious
Clopinel....”</p>

<p>Slump in Royalist plots, arrests. Lacrisse
stands for the town council as a republican
Liberal, with the help of Father Adéodat,
who will let him be a republican in public
if only he will be a true man in committee.
And the Contemporary History ends at a
Royalist dinner-party, on memories of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
riot, the triumph of Mr Loubet, who
triumphed just because he happened to
be there; this is the downfall of reactionary
and clerical hopes, but Madame de
Gromance gives up to Dellion her hospitable
heart....</p>

<p>It all sounds rather cruel, and there are
touches, such as Lacrisse coaching Generals
in the evidence they will deliver against
Dreyfus, such as the description of M. de la
Barge trying to get his son out of military
service after proclaiming that the army is
the ideal of his soul, which provoke in the
reader just what Anatole France wants: not
laughter, but an ironic, lingering, vinegary
smile. Time after time, in every one of his
books he obtains this effect; it is the effect
of sharp contrast, of suddenness; it recalls
a page of Machiavelli who, after describing
how an Italian tyrant had one of his ministers
sawn in half, alive, in the market-place, goes
on: “But to return to more important
things....”</p>

<p>That produces a shock, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
applied to irony this is an effect still more
powerful than when it is applied to fiction,
as, for instance, in Ambrose Bierce’s <i>An
Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</i>. But the
irony is not artificial: it is the sort of irony
given to those who walk the world with their
eyes open. It inspires the feeling of amusement
which invaded a few of us during the
great European War, when we read in the
newspapers articles about Russian culture,
and remembered what the same newspapers
used to say about the Bear. I could not
help smiling at our attitude to the
sausage-eaters when recalling how completely
we had forgotten the frog-eaters and
candle-eaters of times gone by. Very likely,
though the war roused him to action in
defence of ancient French culture, Anatole
France chuckled over the intimate friendship
between France and England, which, in 1898,
at the time of Fashoda, and in 1899, at the
time of the Boer War, was such an intimate
hatred. He would have chuckled still more
had he known that a patriotic English inn-keeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
had changed the name of his tavern
from “The King of Prussia” to “The Czar’s
Head.” For history has staying power, and
one wonders a little whether, as generations
pass, “The Czar’s Head” may not have to
turn into “The Roosevelt Arms,” “The
Garibaldi,” or perhaps one day into “The
Chung Ling Soo....”</p>

<p>But ironic as it all is, it is very living.
This should strike nobody as extraordinary,
for life is most ironic: it would be quite
intolerable to some of us if it were not.
But this is worth saying because a great
many other satirists—Swift, Rabelais, Cervantes—obtain
most of their effects by
distortion. Anatole France obtains his by
bringing out the essential incongruity of life:
funerals passing under the windows of the
Ritz where there is a smart luncheon-party,
sermons bidding us love our enemies while
newsboys shout casualty lists; life is full
of it. That is why the archdeacon and
another cleric hold, in the midst of a theological
crisis, that earnest argument about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
omelettes. Life and people are like that,
and there is nothing at all distorted in the
diplomatic, furry, soft-spoken priests who
... well, let us say, do not discourage their
fair penitents from committing adultery with
powerful republicans, provided this serves a
good cause. After all Judith ... and Jael,
and all that. And it does not seem monstrous
that the new bishop should be selected while
Madame de Gromance does up her suspenders,
for it is quite conceivable that lovers
should now and then, at intervals, talk
politics.</p>

<p>And he is fair. He is not fair like Byron,
who hated most people and disliked the
others, but because he can see oddity and
occasionally beastliness in the people of
whom he approves. He is for the Jews in
this Dreyfus quarrel, but that does not make
him anti-Christian; he is as impartial in
his attacks as a mosquito. Indeed a great
many Jews wish they had been saved from
their friend, for pictures such as that of
Madame Worms-Clavelin and her husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
of Madame de Bonmont, that most Christian
of Jewesses, anxious to forget the tent of
hides, remembering in the most sacred (and
even most amorous) moments that there is
such a thing as a Stock Exchange, are not
always kind.</p>

<p>But, kind or unkind, the satire is never
laid on thickly. Not once does Anatole
France suggest that Mademoiselle Deniseau
is a sham prophetess: no, that would be
clumsy; she merely cannot give the
logarithm of nine....</p>

<p>In those four books modern French society
stands forth quite stark, with a rather decayed
charm, a naïveté born from an excess
of complexity. Anatole France strips it of
all its gewgaws, patriotism, faith, morality:
of all its little affectations; ... and then,
having exposed it, he consents to love it
because his satire rests on his philosophy.
That philosophy, with which I deal further
on, is enunciated in every volume by the
nice old gentlemen who embody him,
Bonnard, Bergeret and the others: irony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
and pity; despise man but love him, see his
weakness and yet hope; he may not be
immortal, yet he is eternal, indestructible as
all matter; and though he be no more than
a mite in cheese yet he is the expression of
life, the soul of beauty, the one thing in the
world which is holy. For Anatole France is
sweet and pitiful. All through his work we
feel that, and in none so much as in a little
story, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Crainquebille</i>. This is the simple tale
of an old hawker who was run in for not
moving on, just because he was waiting for
sixpence owed to him for vegetables. The
policeman trumped up against him a charge
of having shouted “Down with the Peelers!”
When he comes out of gaol Crainquebille is
ostracised; that makes him quarrelsome;
then, having no friends, he drinks; becoming
drunken, he loses his customers and sinks
deeper and deeper into poverty. And the
terrible indictment of the law that makes
criminals by listening to the strong and
flouting the poor, ends on the picture of old
Crainquebille, forlorn, degraded and starving,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
going up to a policeman and shouting:
“Down with the Peelers!” so as to get a
night’s lodging in the cells. But, irony of
ironies, this policeman shrugs his shoulders,
and walks away.</p>

<p>It would not be right to end this chapter
without saying a few words about Anatole
France in his more literal rôle of critic. He
has done an immense amount of literary
criticism in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le Temps</i> and in scattered
articles, most of which have been collected
in the four volumes of <i>On Life and Letters</i>
and in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le Génie Latin</i>. He is sympathetic
and kindly in the extreme when dealing
with the work of young men, particularly
if they are scholars, if they are interested in
the things he loves, mediævalism, sculpture,
history, etc., and he will forgive a great deal
to good intentions, but when he does not
like a book Anatole France is a terrible reviewer,
so terrible a reviewer that I trust
this little monograph will not fall into his
hands. Ignoring then the gentler side of
him, I will reproduce two extracts from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
criticisms. The first is from a review of
Georges Ohnet’s book, entitled <i>Will</i>. Mr
Georges Ohnet, as I suppose everybody
knows, has for a long time enjoyed great
vogue in France for, have no illusions about
it, the French are no more literary than we
are and have a passion for stories of moated
granges, immaculate officers (comparatively
chaste), remorseful women who sacrifice their
beauty for the ideal, and all that sort of
thing; with a little arrangement, the
sentimental-heroic novels of Mrs Barclay, and
the sentimental-religious novels of Mr Hall
Caine would have in France a good circulation.
In fact, the sensuous religiosity of Mr
Hall Caine enjoys in France quite adequate
popularity. And here is what Anatole
France says of this kind of novel, <i>Will</i>, as
published by Mr Georges Ohnet:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The title is a whole philosophy. <i>Will</i>,
that is what speaks to the heart and mind.
<i>Will</i> by Georges Ohnet! How one feels
the man of principle who has never doubted!
<i>Will</i> by Georges Ohnet, 73rd edition! What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
a proof of the power of the will! Locke
did not believe that the world was free.
But his <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>
did not reach seventy-three editions in
a single morning. Here we have Locke
victoriously refuted! The will is not an
illusion, for Mr Georges Ohnet has willed
to have seventy-three editions, and he has
achieved them.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Anatole France, after this amiable beginning,
remarks that Mr Georges Ohnet’s
notions are displeasing, that his style is
ungraceful; he quotes him, and the result is
quite ghastly. And he ends on words which
rescue the reader from doubt:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There is not a page, not a line, not a
word, not a syllable of that book which has
not shocked, saddened, and offended me. I
was disposed to weep over it with all the
muses for company.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Another review, that of Zola’s book, <i>The
Dream</i>, I cannot resist mentioning. The
book is not very well known in England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
which is a pity, as it might please the worshippers
of the latter-day Swan of Avon.
It is pure. Anatole France is aware of that,
for he wickedly heads his review: “Mr
Zola’s Purity.” As it certainly was not
Zola’s habit to be pure, surprise at the
accident was legitimate. And so Anatole
France writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If in order to be poetic, graceful, and
touching, it were enough to resolve, Mr Zola
would certainly be at the present moment
the most graceful, the most poetic, the most
winged, and the most uplifted among
novelists ... he espouses chastity and thus
affords us the most edifying example. One
can only regret that he celebrates this mystic
alliance with too much noise and uproar....”</p></blockquote>

<p>Anatole France analyses the tale of the
beautiful heroine, in her saintly cathedral
town, and adds: “Zinc factories and flat
irons occupy too much space in Mr Zola’s
soul.” He then convicts Zola of gross ignorance
of the period he describes, remarks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
casually: “Saint Joseph’s lily becomes in
his hand an instrument for advertisement,”
and, alluding to his previous works, sums
up: “I prefer Mr Zola on all fours to Mr
Zola winged.”</p>

<span class="subhead">PHILOSOPHER AND THEOLOGIAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Like</span> many agnostics, Anatole France
is more interested in religion than
is many a believer. Like those old
encyclopædists of the eighteenth century,
he is always crushing the infamous one,
which the faithful generally support because
assured that the so-called infamous one
cannot be crushed. And that infamous one
is not only the Catholic religion but religion
itself. I do not want to raise an argument
as to what is religion: in the sense in which
Anatole France attacks it it is a precise faith
in some creative and conscious spirit which
manifests itself, not only in this world, but
in some conceptive other world. Of that
Anatole France will hear nothing. He can
do without it; he is strong enough to stand
alone, and to meet death “as one about to
seek a great perhaps.” He needs no prop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
and he would smile at a letter I received a
little while ago from a devout Catholic who
urged me to draw on “the strength and consolation
which streamed from that little hill
near Jerusalem, two thousand years ago, and
now flows from the slope that rises by the
side of the yellow waters of the Tiber.”
Anatole France sees the poetry of this conception,
but though he sees the idea as
poetic he does not see the statement as true.
For him religion or faith is cowardice; it
is the cry of man who dares not die, and in
every one of his books he has used the most
cunning methods to express his feeling.</p>

<p>One of the most notable ways has been to
express the ideas of men through the mouth
of Riquet, the dog.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> For the dog, as Anatole
France said in another place, is a religious
beast, and here are some of the thoughts
which pass through its brain:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p><blockquote>

<p>“My master warms me when I lie behind
him in his armchair; that is because he is
a god.” (“The Lord will provide.”) “In
my master’s voice are many vain sounds.
It is difficult and necessary to define the
thought of the master.” (Catholic exegesis
of the Bible.) “I love my master, Bergeret,
because he is terrible and powerful.”
(Jewish worship of Jehovah.) And the little
black dog prays:</p>

<p>“Oh, my master, Bergeret, God of
Slaughter, I worship thee! Hail, oh God
of wrath! Hail, oh bountiful God! I lie at
thy feet, I lick thy hand. Thou art great
and beautiful when at the laden board thou
devourest abundant meats. Thou art great
and beautiful when, from a thin strip of wood
causing flame to spring, thou dost of night
make day....”</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>In <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Monsieur Bergeret à Paris</i>, and in the story
entitled <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Riquet</i>.</p></div>

<p>Here indeed in the old professor who can
whip Riquet is the God of Sabaoth, the God
of Battles; in the professor with the carving
knife is He who multiplied the fishes and the
loaves. And I need not labour that when
Bergeret strikes a match it is very wonderful:
so was Genesis and the making of the
sun....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
For his aggressive, childish superstitions,
for his puerile desire to find an unnatural
explanation to what he does not understand,
Anatole France might despise man,
yet he loves him. He finds charm in hierophantic
absurdity; he feels the poetry of
the little hill. And he goes further: he
feels the poetry even of the Middle Ages,
though it was a period of bestial and ungraceful
ignorance, raping knights, robber
troubadours and fine ladies who never
changed their underclothing; he loves
historic truth as well as the highfalutin nonsense
of Amadis of Gaul. For Amadis has a
picaresque air. In his book, <i>The Well of
St Clare</i> notably, are several stories supposed
to be told by a Siennese priest. There
is that of Saint Satyr, out of whose tomb
came a multitude of mists, each one of
which was a woman. They floated in the
darkling air; through their light tunics
shone their light bodies. The clerics had
hunted them into the tomb of the saint who
was accepted of God the Christ, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the goat worshipped in his own fashion.
(Anatole France hints that all religions have
the same root and that one worshipper is as
good as another; he has written another story
on these lines, <i>Amycus and Célestin</i>.) The
tomb is opened and the heart of the priest
who saw the vision is in most mediæval style
torn out by the ghosts of hags. In another
story, <i>The Security</i>, the Virgin stands bail
for a year for a debt, and leads the merchant’s
barque back in time to redeem her, because
he believed in her; there are other queer
stories, such as <i>The Lady of Verona</i>, who so
loved her body that she begged Satan to
save it; such as <i>The Mystery of the Blood</i>,
where a saint cheers a criminal whose blood
falls upon her gown. She says: “Take not
from me my purple and my perfumes.” In
all these stories he shows how charmed he
is by this childish mediævalism. And yet
he does not espouse it, for in the <i>Opinions
of Jérome Coignard</i> he says: “All those
stories of Satanic fornication are disgusting
dreams, and it is a shame that Jesuits and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Dominicans should have made them up into
treatises.”</p>

<p>His theology is usually intermingled with
his philosophy. In the story called <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Komm
l’Atrébate</i> (in <i>Clio</i>) the warrior believes that
the same moon does not shine over Rome
and over Gaul, because Rome is so far away;
in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Muiron</i> (in <i>Clio</i>) Buonaparte expounds
his theory of government by faith: “The
right to deny God is granted to a learned
man shut up in his study, not to a leader of
peoples whose power over the vulgar rests
upon his community with their ideas. To
govern men one must think like them on
all great questions and allow oneself to be
carried by public opinion.”</p>

<p>Anatole France wishes to govern no man,
and to be governed of no man. He is the
most anarchistic of Socialists. And how
could he feel otherwise if indeed he be
Coignard, who “despised man tenderly,”
who thought that “on earth one cannot
help sinning”? The Abbé Coignard, in
1893, was full of cynical contempt for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
democracy, of disbelief in the importance
of forms of government, and in the value of
change; yet Coignard hated prisons and
armies; he thought all war hateful, except
civil war; for him glory, nobility,
honour were words; glory, notably, was
accident; modesty was Calvinism; he
thought that there was a pure and an
impure, but heaven alone knew which was
which.... All that is the Francian philosophy
mixed in with the Francian religion:
doubts and smiles.</p>

<p>But now and then, when he is annoyed by
the externals of Christianity, Anatole France
becomes more militant. He has written
(in <i>Mother of Pearl</i>) a story entitled <i>The
Procurator of Judæa</i>, which ranks with the
finest of de Maupassant’s, and is deeper in
intention than anything de Maupassant ever
wrote. A generation after the Crucifixion,
Pilate, then talking the waters for gout in
Northern Italy, meets an old friend who
was once at Jerusalem. They talk of
horses, of the policy of Vitellius, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
waters, of the things that would interest
Roman gentlemen, and, little by little, they
come to talk of those silly, noisy, obstinate
Jews who used to raise such wrangles and
such schisms in Jerusalem. And they talk
of Mary Magdalene, in her pre-scriptural
days: “By the light of a smoky little lamp,
on a wretched carpet she danced, raising
her arms to strike the cymbals. Her back
arched, her head thrown back, as if drawn
down by the heavy weight of her ruddy
hair, her eyes drowned in lust, ardent and
languishing, she would have caused Cleopatra
herself to blush for envy....” They
sigh, for Magdalene was very beautiful and
seductive (in her pre-scriptural days). Then
the friend recalls that she followed “a young
Galilean thaumaturge who was crucified,”
says the friend, “for I don’t know what
crime.” Pontius Pilate thinks for a long
time; crucifixion was so commonplace in
those days. After a while he says:
“Jesus? Jesus of Nazareth? No, I don’t
remember him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
I know that many who read this will
charge Anatole France with blasphemy.
Well, blasphemy has its uses: it parts the
sheep from the goats; it impresses the
waverers and drives such of them as are
weak of faith into agnosticism, while it
shocks the faithful and strengthens their
militancy. The blasphemer may render a
service to the faith. Blasphemy need not
be ignorant; indeed, true blasphemy is
possible only in the enlightened: the unenlightened
find it easier to believe; it
is so difficult to believe when one does not
know. Now Anatole France does not know,
and he is, so far as that goes, in the position
of St Francis, but where he differs from St
Francis is that he does not believe that which
he does not know. (I am assuming that St
Francis did believe, that he did more than
want to believe.) For Anatole France
understands perfectly well the Catholic
attitude and its Christian variations; he
has a full understanding of it, its simplicity,
gaiety, charm, of its tender humanity, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
beautiful Catholic sympathy with the weakness
of man, with the feeble hands that cannot
seize more than the hem of the seamless
garment. He loves this Catholicism which
he detests because, after all, while spreading
among the people brute ignorance, infamous
asceticism, prejudices and an intolerance
resulting in a cruelty foreign to the tiger, it
somehow, through the Dark Ages, kept burning
the flame of the arts. The Catholicism
of Anatole France is that of Cimabue, of
Raphael, of Marot, of Shakespeare (no
Protestant he), the Catholicism of those
friars who pored over Greek texts, of those
inspired workmen who painted stained glass,
of the fine ladies with the pearl-braided hair
who, with hands delicate as sprays of fern,
embroidered chasubles, and, all of them,
interposed a bulwark between the culture
of man and the stinking men-at-arms.
That Catholicism is the Catholicism of song
and dance, the Catholicism of the juggler
and the troubadour, not only the Catholicism
of the stake but the Catholicism of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Merrie England before Calvin came to blow
a black breath upon a world not yet made
grey by the Galilean.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>Anatole France would hate our Puritan practices,
such as the prohibition of billiards in hotels and of
cricket in the parks on Sunday.</p></div>

<p>It might be concluded that Anatole France
is an atheist, but that is not correct; he
has said too definitely that though man may
not be immortal, he is eternal. He merely
does not know whence we came nor whither
we go, nor I think does he care much; he is
merely a member of the band, Voltaire,
Renan, Huxley, Spencer, Darwin, Haeckel
(doubtful that one), who were not willing
to believe without understanding, and yet
agreed that there might be something in
which to believe if one could understand it.
Briefly, he is an agnostic. He refuses to
make the slightly self-conscious effort which
certain literary men, in England and in
France, successfully make to accept the
spiritual origin of miracles and such like
matters. What is, is, and what may be, may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
be: that is enough. But his theology is so
intermingled with his human interests that
at bottom he is a pagan; he loves beauty so
well that he discovers it even in faith, and it
is evident that he would have found much
pleasure in the rites of the ancient Greeks.
In his celebrated novel, <i>Thais</i>, he hails pagan
beauty as he holds up for our contemptuous
sympathy the sorrow of Paphnutius, the
monk of Arsinoe. The monk set forth to
redeem Thais, the courtesan; for her beauty
and her soul he abandoned his cell and his
hair shirt. She was unhappy and superstitious,
and she feared the life to come;
at his behest she turned to the Christian
God. But Paphnutius burned himself with
the torch he had lit; Thais assailed him in
dream, and though he strove to fight his
passion by solitude, by fasting, by becoming
a stylite, he failed. In dream he dishonoured
his soul, and at last, surrendering,
he rushed to Thais, but found her dying and
become a saint; doubt, fear and despair
had compassed his downfall, and it was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
late to love: he could be naught save a
vampire.</p>

<p>The story is one of violent pageantry,
of Alexandria crimson, purple and gold, of
Alexandria dancing on the rosy wharves
where great ships with brown sails unloaded
silks and spices, Alexandria offering up to
the old gods, Hermes of the secret smile
and Aphrodite of the cup-like breasts, not
the smoking holocausts of Jehovah, but
honey and garlands of flowers.... And
on the other side, quite near the sceptical,
cynical, gay, intellectual Greeks, who for a
pastime and as in a Chelsea drawing-room
discussed man and God, the horrid state of
the Christian anchorites, self-starved, self-flogged,
verminous, sour, contemptuous of
the beauty of the body, of learning. There
is a bitter irony in the efforts of Paphnutius,
the stylite, for as he sits upon his column as
far as he can from man and as near as possible
to God, his reputation as a saint waxes;
round him there grows a town, Stylopolis,
an ancestor of Lourdes; first of all come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
shrines and convents, then traders, then a
government, then banks, theatres ... the
rich, the sons of the rich ... courtesans.
He does not hate Paphnutius nor love him,
for the monk was unfortunate, not guilty;
gladly would he have torn out his heart and
burnt it as an offering to God the Christ.
His was a white, burning soul, but he had beyond
a soul a body needing lightness, satisfaction.
His flesh was weak, and it is pitiful
rather than rejoicing that Anatole France
sorrows for his error, when the monk sees
Lucifer as “the serpent with golden wings
which twisted round the tree of knowledge
its azure coils formed of light and love,”
when he sees Jehovah, the brutish tyrant,
the power of ignorance and superstition, the
power of darkness, Jehovah, understanding
nothing, a mere dream. It is a terrible
day for Paphnutius when he understands that
“the Serpent began to speak to Adam and
Eve and to teach them the highest truths,
those which do not demonstrate themselves.”</p>

<p>All this feeling is in <i>The Revolt of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Angels</i>, the most remarkable of Anatole
France’s theological books, as <i>Penguin
Island</i> is his principal political book. It is
an amusing story, this idea that the angels,
as knowledge and thought spread among
them, should one by one desert the heavenly
choir, come to earth to live among men,
to love them, and attempt to overthrow
Him who has stood in the way of every
science and of every art. The book is
brilliant because it so casually intermingles
the actual with the fantastic. The angels
who descend to earth and turn into men
become music masters (obviously), conspirators,
commercial travellers, and here
below prepare the spiritual revolution. The
career of the principal angel, Arcade, is exceedingly
amusing, for he ravages by night
the theological libraries, being bent on gaining
an education which was not given him in
Paradise. And there is a fair amount of
the most incongruous, but almost engaging,
indecency. It would be too much to describe
the incident exactly here, but I think I may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
say that Arcade, who is the guardian angel
of a young man called Maurice, appears in
the latter’s bedroom at a moment ... well,
at an inopportune moment. And when at
last he has convinced Maurice that he really
is an angel, Maurice says something which
could be said only by a Parisian: “You
may be an angel, but you are not a man of
the world.” He is wrong, for a little later
Arcade, in the very same room, demonstrates
to the lady whose reputation he compromised
by his sudden materialisation,
that angels are close relatives of men.</p>

<p>But apart from scenes where angels button
up the boots of ladies, which is very clever
of them, considering how little practice they
can have had, there is in the book to a much
greater extent than in <i>Thais</i> a passionate
plea for the intellectual side of paganism,
the one embodying all that is young and all
that is enlightened, embodying the joys
which the god of the Jews endeavoured to
drive out of the domain of man. And there
is more than one picture of Satan as the god<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
of grace (presumably precipitated into hell
on account of his advanced ideas), of Satan
loving man. There is picture after picture
of the Son of the Morning who once was
Pan. In the end the angels do not revolt,
for Satan in his dream realises that if he
overthrows God and establishes himself as
another god, he will only become as his predecessor,
harsh, dogmatic, intolerant, greedy
of praise, hostile to anything which might
rear up in the mind of the people the idea
of a new god. Satan will not reign, and he
sums up: “What matters if man is no longer
subject to Ialdabaoth, if the spirit of Ialdabaoth
is still in them? if like him they are
jealous, violent, quarrelsome, greedy, inimical
to the arts and to beauty? what matters
if they have rejected the ferocious demon
if they listen not to the friendly demons
who teach all truths, to Dionysus, Apollo
and the muses? As for us, celestial spirits,
sublime demons, we have destroyed Ialdabaoth,
our tyrant, if we have destroyed in
ourselves ignorance and fear.”</p>

<span class="subhead">HISTORIAN AND POLITICIAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Though</span> deeply interested in the
past, Anatole France has written
singularly little pure history. His
vision being universal, most of his critical
work is informed with historic feeling, but
in spite of his love of ancient chronicles,
in spite of knowledge which might shame
the College of Heralds and the Record Office
put together, he has preferred to use history
as raw material for romance. He has been
right, in a way, for most historians have
used romance as the raw material of history
and made of it, with a few exceptions, such
as Green, Gibbon, Michelet, Mommsen, an
unreadable, unfinished product. Anatole
France knows that, and possibly he has
hesitated to write history because he had
not the details he needed to write it as he
wished; those details were the history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the people, the real history, the ploughman’s
menu, and what the merchant said
to his wife about Mr Pitt before they fell
asleep; battles and dates make him smile.
He expresses this very well in the preface to
<i>The Life of Joan of Arc</i>. “To discern the
future one must consider not the enterprises
of the great but the confused movements of
the labouring masses.”</p>

<p>Once only has he written an actual historic
work, and that is his monumental study of
Joan of Arc. It has made him more unpopular
than all his works put together,
from which it is easy to conclude that it
is a work of worth and nobility. It is an
enormous, encyclopædic study showing that
he has consulted every possible source of
information: archives, chronicles, diaries,
private letters and reports of the merest tittle
tattle; he knows almost too much about the
Maid of Orleans, and this makes it difficult
to read the work. But the one who perseveres
will be richly rewarded, for Anatole
France sheds some new light upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chevalière</i>. It is the preface and the addendum
have made him hated by the clericals,
for he impugns the chronicles as mostly
having been written by chroniclers paid by
the knights; pitilessly he shows up their
discrepancies, their omissions, he depicts
Joan of Arc as a hallucinated, hysterical
girl, subject to visions which in those days
afflicted many a girl on the threshold of
womanhood. For him her sight, smell,
hearing, sense of contact, all were decayed,
and he inclines to think that she was influenced
by priests favourable to the cause
of Charles VII. Those priests were
politicians and, knowing her simplicity, led
her and used her. They had no difficulty
in this, for the people were ignorant and
believed because they wanted to believe.
As he himself says: “Belief in her sanctity
was as hypnotic as would be to-day a belief
in aeroplanes.” It is not wonderful that,
assuming an attitude such as this towards one
whom M. Bergeret called a military mascot,
Anatole France should have been violently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
attacked by the reactionaries; that was a
little unfair, for all through the book Anatole
France recognises the simplicity, the purity,
the courage and the true enthusiasm of
Joan, but he will not grant her divine inspiration.
That is unpardonable in the eyes
of the reactionaries, who forget that it took
the popes over four hundred and fifty years
to canonise her; they want to use Joan of
Arc in the cause of the Church and the King,
and it does not do at all to have that touching
conviction disturbed: it was not the
Kaiser invented the alliance of Meinself
(und Gott).</p>

<p>Animosity has not disturbed Anatole
France, for “one conquers the earth only
by ploughing it.” He has told the story
simply, without heroics, painted a poetic
picture of Joan growing up “on bitter soil
among rough and sober folk, fed on rosy
wine and brown bread, hardened by a hard
life”; she had knowledge of tree-worship,
and hung garlands on the boughs as does
to-day Russian youth on the birch-tree;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
she was a pagan and grew up among private
wars, fire, blood and murder. It is all
extraordinarily living, for Anatole France
speaks familiarly, using the names of local
tradesmen, peasants and lawyers. And so
the story goes on on the well-known lines,
continually critical, for Joan reveals the
clerical influence by using terms known
only to ecclesiastics<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>; she uses sometimes
peasant language, sometimes rhetoric, as if
she had a double personality; she is fierce,
obstinate, firm, as if hypnotised; she impresses
the crowd by refusing Charles the
name of King until she herself has led him
to Reims. Anatole France is fair even to
the English, who were cruel only because
they were afraid of her as “a superhuman,
terrible, frightful creature, a demon from
hell before whom the bravest quailed.”
Anatole France criticises Joan also as a
strategist, in which rôle, it seems, she was
most incompetent; but faith may inflame
where strategy fails. Her strength came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
evidently from her inflated view of her
mission, so common in lunatic asylums, for
she went so far as to dream of a crusade
against the Turks and the Hussites....</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>Miracle?</p></div>

<p>All this is implied, not stated; Anatole
France advances few opinions, digresses not
often; he tells the story simply and allows
us to draw our own conclusions. Apart
from the historical references, the book is
as simple as Renan’s <i>Life of Jesus</i>, and
as damaging. Anatole France is happiest
when painting pictures of the enthusiastic
mobs, swearing the oaths of men-at-arms
and singing songs with the ribald women,
painting pictures of the towns in the wars
of the Middle Ages. At times, however, he
cannot restrain himself, must discuss a side
issue that interests him, such as the worship
of virtue and of virgins. Then his charm
grows Virgilian: “In this land of Gaul
the white priestesses of the forests had
left some memory of their holy beauty;
and sometimes one saw, fleeting in the Isle
of Sein, along the misty shores of the sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
the pale shadow of the nine sisters who,
in bygone days, at will laid or awoke the
storm.”</p>

<p>It is not a disrespectful, but a critical
book, and I suppose it is true enough that
the inspiration of Joan merely served to
bring luck to the French troops, was indeed
a military mascot. To claim more is to
claim a little too much, for did not, during
the European War, Englishmen, Frenchmen,
Russians, Germans all invoke the
Almighty and make quite sure that He was
on their side? Yet everybody cannot win;
the Christian God is no Janus.</p>

<p>Far more interesting for ordinary reading
is his pseudo-novel, <i>The Gods are Athirst</i>.
In that book he tells the story of a Jacobin,
Gamelin, living through the Revolution of
1789, active terrorist, ready to sacrifice sister,
mother, sweetheart, upon the altar of
liberty, hard, narrow in the forehead,
obsessed. Anatole France leads us through
sumptuous scenes, the murder of Marat, the
death of Robespierre, while Gamelin every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
day grows more bloodthirsty, more pitiless.
The creature is marvellously living, for in
his madness and his blood-lust he responds
to all the affectations of revolutionary days,
the personal oppositions between the red
hands and the white hands, to the ridiculous
imitation of Roman citizenship which led to
men calling themselves Brutus or Cicero. Yet
the ridiculous is not without its nobility, for
Gamelin falls at last a victim to the guillotine,
and then says, splendidly: “I die justly.
It is well that we should bear those insults
levelled at the republic against which we
should have protected it. We were weak,
we have been guilty of indulgence. We have
betrayed the republic.... Robespierre himself,
pure and saintly, sinned by gentleness,
by pity ... I have spared blood, let my
blood flow.” That is not so extraordinary
as it seems, for Gamelin, the executioner,
believes in virtue, in a high ideal and, as
everybody should know, there is no creature
in the world so brutal and so venomous as
one who is working for the good of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
The virtue of the book is not in the
history, but in Anatole France’s acute consciousness
of the things that happen while
history is being made. There are picnics,
talks about art; there is a sentimental
amourette between Brotteaux, the old
aristocrat, and a sweet courtesan; there is
an old priest who does not mind having his
head cut off, but does object in court to being
called a Capuchin when he really is a
Barnabite. It is all deeply human, and one
scene at least is unforgettable, a love scene.
(Of course ... those are mostly unforgettable.)
It is not the recurrent scene
between Gamelin and his mistress who,
by the way, and it is a charming irony,
invites his rival to her bedroom on the
day of Gamelin’s execution in exactly the
words she used to Gamelin himself; it is
a scene on the day when Charlotte Corday
murdered Marat. There is a great crowd
and Gamelin, in the press, meets his friend
Desmahis. He tries to detain him to talk
about Marat, but Desmahis is almost in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
tears; he curses the crowd, he was following
a fair-haired girl, a shopgirl, a divine girl,
and the crowd has parted them. “But
Marat ...” says Gamelin. “Marat, Marat!”
growls Desmahis. “That’s all very well,
but I’ve lost my fair-haired girl.”</p>

<p>It is hard to realise that men follow shopgirls
while empires fall, but it is most likely,
and I suspect that Anatole France thinks
it more important.</p>

<p>As it is the fate of Anatole France to be
unpopular whatever he does, it is not surprising
that <i>The Gods are Athirst</i> should
have annoyed the advanced people as much
as <i>The Life of Joan of Arc</i> did the reactionaries.
That is because he loves truth and
is one of the few people in the world who
realise that truth is neither blue nor buff.
He has been charged with having fouled
the noblest work of man; that is untrue,
only he is determined not to be taken in
and will not see the Red Virgin as spotless.
Great things can be done by little men, done
clumsily, cruelly, and yet somehow done.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
That is more or less what Anatole France
shows in this book; the verdict of the
people is not for him the voice of God, but
this does not imply that the voice of the
aristocrat is any more divine. He cannot
help seeing that the democracy is ignorant,
prejudiced, greedy, coarse-minded, and yet
at the same time he finds in it the seeds of
generosity and of that justice so much more
costly than the mercy now and then vouchsafed
with a fine gesture by those who
dominate man. Irony and pity, pity and
hope, it is always the same gospel.</p>

<p>In <i>The Gods are Athirst</i> Anatole France
seemed to have receded from the pronounced
socialism which colours his views. That is
all on the surface, and in <i>The Revolt of the
Angels</i>, published a year later, it was
obvious that he had denied none of his
views; only, and it is so difficult to make
people understand this, Anatole France
is a Socialist and he is also sane. He
will not have it that a Socialist is necessarily
a saint; that the democracy is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
immaculate; and it is because he finds
the human being behind the tribune, while
the followers of the tribune insist upon seeing
him as a sort of historical hero, a county
Achilles, that in their quite honest stupidity
they are annoyed. If Anatole France had
been born in England and entered politics
there, his influence would not have been
large, because, in this country, what we like
is a good, stodgy, immovable view; if at
the age of twenty you believed in Mr
Gladstone, at the age of sixty you have to
believe in Mr Asquith, and there you are.
Doggedness, never say die, the bulldog
breed, all that sort of stuff. The idea is
that one should run one’s head against a
brick wall in the hope of knocking it over:
one does sometimes, if one’s head is hard
enough, but that successful kind of head
does not readily admit a new idea. Being
a Frenchman, Anatole France has been more
fortunate; he is not a bit more original
than Mr. Shaw, though infinitely more
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sympatique</i>, for his smile is honeyed, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
vinegary; still, if Mr Shaw had been a
Frenchman his countrymen would have
taken him seriously. And we, too, perhaps,
once he was translated.</p>

<p>Anatole France came into the open in the
course of the Dreyfus case, and since that
time he has never ceased to interest himself
actively instead of philosophically in everything
that was unhappy and oppressed—workers,
natives, generally speaking the
underdogs. His little book, <i>The Church
and the Republic</i>, published in 1905, in which
he demolishes the case for the absolute
freedom of the Catholic Church, because
there is not absolute freedom, but only so
much as does not clash with other freedoms,
had an immense success and powerfully
assisted M. Combes in his campaign for
Disestablishment. Anatole France, heir of
Voltaire and Renan, has always seen the
Church, a survival full of charm and grace,
as the enemy of the people. Had it not
been for the hierarchy, I do not believe he
would have attacked the faith: religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
would have made a pretty toy for the child
that calls itself man. But religion allied
with ministers and financiers, sabre-rattlers,
religion <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la</i> Kaiser, he has sworn to root out.
He wants to do this because he has a vision
of a humanity to come when none shall
suffer at the hands of the State, when one
sex will not crush and the other deceive,
when black faces may smile on white. He
has expounded his creed in many political
speeches, though he is not a good speaker;
he has come before his audience with his
long, whimsical, Pan-like face and his
sorrowful eyes, flicking them with irony and
yet touching their hearts, asking always for
justice and yet for sanity. His speeches are
like his writings, except that he has a Latin
fondness for the rhetorical question. They
are polished, literary, and he generally begins
like an American by telling his audience
one or two humorous stories: he believes
in laughter, and he who laughs with him
will soon think with him. But there is
always a sting in those stories: it is not for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
nothing that he is so fond of telling the old
fairy tale of the wrestler who could turn
himself into a dragon and then, if St George
appeared, into a duck: there are many
of our Cabinet ministers who have been
dragons at the Albert Hall and ducks in
Committee Room 15, with, as Anatole
France says, “a domestic animal’s mild
voice.”</p>

<p>It is, however, his writings that matter
most; though opposed to war, it is interesting
to observe that he approves of the
European War of 1914. At the age of
seventy he demonstrated this by laying
down his pen and asking the French War
Office for a rifle. But in the main he
hates war, though he be not Tolstoyan
enough to believe in non-resistance. He
hates war because it is not good business
for the soul of man; I do not think he is
much upset by slaughter or starvation, for
humanity must die somehow, but he knows
that a war makes vile those who survive.
And if one reads <i>The White Stone</i> one easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
understands him. It is an incoherent work,
for the several stories it contains are quite
unrelated; it is the sort of conversation
four or five cultured men might hold if they
were to sit up for the night with wine and
cigarettes. It is rather long-winded, here
and there dull, pedagogic, but it represents
him fairly well from an intellectual point
of view, though it contains none of the
indecency, blasphemy and Falstaffian fun
which pervade his writings. It is philosophical,
a little rigid, rather Protestant:
but then Anatole France is seldom a good
Catholic, except when he is chalking up
on the cathedral wall: “To hell with the
Pope!” The first part is classical, and
holds nothing that he has not said in other
works except one concentrated phrase:
“The saints are a new mythology.” He
then passes on to the story of Gallio, who
is perhaps, philosophically speaking, the
most seductive pagan in the New Testament,
a minor rival being, of course, Pontius
Pilate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Here is Gallio, administrator of a Roman
province, facing the problems of Nero’s
unsuitable marriage with Octavia, of the
education of little boys, and of the fish
trade.... It is all very Roman, a little
pompous, a little dull, rather like England
about 1860. Gallio is not joyous, for he
has no illusions; he knows that “men will
die, will kill every enemy,” that “human
laws are daughters of anger and fear.”
And he has official troubles, for the Jews
are always indulging in religious wrangles,
refusing to have images of the emperor
in their temples. This gets Gallio into
trouble, and he thinks it absurd, for “one
should honour all religions, think them all
holy.” But the wrangles of the Jews are
forced on him, and he despairs of making
them understand that they must manage
their own silly business, that he is interested
only in law and order. He personally
thinks that this new God, Christ, is a mere
jumble of two old ones, of Orpheus, who
descended into hell, and of Adonis, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
suffered and died. Gallio does not object
to the new God, but he wishes he would not
embarrass the Government; in Gallio’s
view the new God is a bore, but he is also
a nuisance, for “there are in Asia lots of
these youthful gods who die and rise again,
and good women take more pleasure in
them than they should.” And then Gallio
goes on wearily to control complex administration,
while the modernised fictional
version of the Acts unfolds ... and Stephen
is stoned while a philosopher makes love
to Ioessa....</p>

<p>This touches Anatole France’s theories of
government, and it is not wonderful that he
should be so interested in Saint Paul, whom
Gallio would have looked upon as an uneducated
person. He speculates agreeably
on the discomfort Paul would feel in Rome
to-day, unable to understand Catholics and
Protestants, and amazed because Judgement
Day had not yet occurred. “The
only place for him to-day would be Jerusalem.”
But Anatole France does not long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
dwell upon this jumble of religion and
government which was evidently suggested
to him by the differences between the
French State and the Catholic Church. He
becomes more general. He believes in a
future peace brought about, not by man’s
goodness, but by economic necessity, which
must please Mr Norman Angell. This, of
course, involves a change in our attitude to
coloured races, who “know us only by our
crimes.” Anatole France sees that from the
point of view of Asia we are the white peril,
and he can find no reason why Admiral Togo
should not come with twelve battleships to
bombard Brest to assist the Japanese trade
in France. And then he agreeably meanders;
he figures the revolting French besieging
the legations of China and Japan in Paris,
and Marshal Oyama bringing the allied
armies of the East to the Boulevard des
Italiens to demand the punishment of the
French Boxers, burning down Versailles in
the name of a superior civilisation, and stealing
the dinner-set of the Elysée. It is all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
very cutting if we remember what we did
in 1900, and Anatole France amiably adds:
“No, this has not happened. Yellow men
are not civilised enough so faithfully to
imitate the white.”</p>

<p>For Anatole France, the colonial mania
is purely economic, and he considers that
Japan has done a great service to the union
of races by compelling the white man to
respect the yellow; he does not despair
even of the black, who, he points out, are
evolving in South America, growing educated
and much superior to the Europeans
of 2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Of course this means “no
more colonies,” which he looks upon as
swindles, for “France has expended men
and money so that the Congo, Cochin-China,
Annam, Tonkin ... may buy cotton-goods
in Manchester, weapons in Birmingham
and Liège, spirits in Dantzig, and claret
in Hamburg.” He is right, though
humanity will not realise that until the day
comes for it to haul down its buntings. But
he is not hopeless. He believes that even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
military men are growing more peaceful,
that they want “a pompous, magnificent,
shining peace, proud as war.” Evidently
he must hold such a belief, for in the same
book is his idea of Utopia. It is a queer,
intellectual Utopia, very different from Mr
Wells’, and probably rather distasteful to
most of us. He figures men and women in
the international State, dressed alike (and I
wonder whether the other Anatole France
has not in his mind the wicked thought of
encouraging delightful surprises), work done
by machines, a six-hours’ day, aeroplanes,
small private dwellings, no towns, few
crimes (property having gone); he suppresses
the legal class, alcohol ... he even
suppresses the colon by operation and then
eugenics. It is the ordinary Socialist
Utopia with the labour bond system, the
right to live for art and science, and the
wages of ability; the family, of course,
goes, and the sexless increase. That is not
unattractive, for I gather that Anatole
France wishes to make procreation less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
accidental and to confine it to those who
feel intimately impelled to it. He sees the
cinema and the phonograph ousting the
book, which is too individualistic; drama
as dead, owing to a lack of comedy and
tragedy in life. That is what most of us will
dislike in his Utopia (that is to say, tragedy
in the lives of other people and comedy in
ours). Religion persists, but in a great
schismatic mess, and there is even a Pope
who fulfils his mission after hours, for he is
a dyer in Rome. All this is fairly commonplace,
but it carries a number of fine criticisms,
some of them generous, such as that
of capitalism, which “was a great social progress,
created the proletariat, made a state
inside the State, prepared the emancipation
of the workers and supplied them with
means to power.” That shows a true sense
of the evolution of man: the need for
educating him out of his nomadic state by
showing him how to combine in factories,
armies, republics. And Anatole France is
not too ambitious, for he does not think that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
equality can be established “as we do not
know what it is.” All he wants is to assure
a living to all and to make work honourable.
Likewise he does not imagine perfect
liberty, because it is not possible, and, above
all, he does not believe that men will be good
or bad: “They will be what they will be.”</p>

<p>That is what he dreams as he sleeps on
the white stone, the species of man evolving
into another race possibly fine, possibly vile,
but yet worth dreaming of because, as Mr
Wells says, man is not final, and so long
as a thing is not final it has the charm of a
closed bud that conceals a flower the colour
of which we do not know. Anatole France
does not say whether the flower will burst
forth gorgeous red or virginal white; it will
be what it will be, and so best, for whatever
its colour and its form it will be that thing
which he loves in his quiet, smiling, sober
way, the flower of life.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> may seem <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">énorme</i> and yet somehow
it is not: Anatole France is
not exactly a literary man. He is
not a literary man in the sense of Flaubert
or Turgenev, for he is not content with being
the god in the machine, he is always allowing
you to see him guiding it; indeed in
most of his work he is the god in the car.
That is probably why Anatole France has
never adopted classical form. He appreciates
it, and in the many critical articles he
has written he has praised just those people
whose form was perfect ... but it is the
sick man, not the robust man admires health.
There is not one of his novels properly holds
together. I mean that there is not one that
develops harmoniously the story of certain
human beings in a given atmosphere. At
times, for instance in the four volumes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
<i>Contemporary History</i>, you have the sense
of developing lives, and then Anatole
France puts on somebody else’s coat, like
Maître Jacques, transforms himself from
coachman into cook, calls himself Bergeret
or Bonnard, or, more audaciously, takes on
the shape of Vence, the genial worldling, or
of Dechartre, the passionate sculptor, and
talks. As soon as that happens the novel
is forgotten; Anatole France takes the
reader by the hand and draws him away
to pick intellectual primroses. A delightful
exercise; only when hundreds of these
primroses are picked you have forgotten
the novel you deserted. I have mentioned
already the incoherence of <i>The Crime of
Sylvestre Bonnard</i>. Then there is the
famous <i>Red Lily</i>, which is supposed to be
a love story; it is a love story of the most
passionate kind, only it is so inextricably
mixed up with mystical excursions by a
vagabond, ragged poet, evidently modelled
on Verlaine, with views on pictorial art by
Vence and Dechartre, that, interested as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
one is all the time, one loses one’s sense of
proportion. When the lovers meet in the
beautiful Florentine pavilion one is never
sure that theirs is a love feast: at any
moment it may turn into an essay on the
glazes of Botticelli. Anatole France must
at one time have been conscious of this, for
in one of his books, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Histoire Comique</i>, he
made a great effort to tell the story of a
little actress who threw over her actor lover
for a young diplomat, and found after the
suicide of the actor that never more could
she come together with her new lover because
in their tenderest moments she was
haunted by the bloody spectre of the
dead man. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Histoire Comique</i> is finely
written, and in the best French literary
style; it eloquently evokes the life of the
French actress, so much on the edge of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demi-monde</i> and now and then over the edge.
It is almost as good as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Petites Cardinal</i>
... and then Anatole France spoils it. In
comes Doctor Trublet, in other words
Anatole France himself, talking about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
medicine, about morality, about faith, talking,
everlastingly talking. Trublet talks
delightfully, but while he talks one thinks
of the pretty little actress in whom one had
grown interested, and thinks: “Oh, dear old
doctor, do stop talking; kisses, not words,
shall win the prize.” But then Anatole
France has never cared whether his ideas
were relevant to the <em>story</em>; it has always
been enough for him that they should be
relevant to the <em>temperament</em> he sketches.</p>

<p>Perhaps for this reason, and it is an important
observation if one is to judge Anatole
France fairly, his characters are unusually
living. People like Captain Victor, Tudesco,
bombastic, ebullient, Falstaffian people,
move in our midst. Their creator is always
poking fun at them; persistently he erects
Aunt Sallies and then throws bouquets at
them. He teases them because he loves
them. It should be observed, however, and
I do not want to be ill-natured about it,
that Anatole France never pokes fun at
the characters that embody his own personality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
Bergeret, the other nice old gentlemen,
Vence, Dechartre, are never absurd;
they are amiable, scholarly, tender, generous,
and have a strong sense of humour. I do
not say that Anatole France ought to see
his ridiculous side; I do not see it myself,
but it must be there. Only, and you must
take my word for this without asking for
evidence, it is not in the nature of any human
being, save the Englishman, to “take himself
off.” I have known a good many Frenchmen,
Germans, Austrians, Spaniards, and
have never found in any one of them a
glimmer of self-deprecation: they were all
supermen, and I expect were much the same
before the birth of Nietzsche. Still, and I
repeat that I do not want to be ill-natured
about it, in spite of that little failing, it
must be owned that this little band of incarnations
of Anatole France is very human;
after all, Anatole France is probably human
himself, so far as a man can be human when
he is sane. Their humanity resides in their
passion for life. Every one of them holds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the creed which is ideally stated in the
preface to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mademoiselle de Maupin</i>. As
I believe Anatole France admires Gautier, I
will venture to quote from it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Pleasure seems to me to be the object of
life, and the only useful thing in the world.
God has so willed it, who made women,
perfume, light, beautiful flowers, good wines,
spirited horses, greyhounds and Persian
cats. He has not said to his angels: ‘Have
virtue,’ but ‘Have love,’ and has given us
lips more sensitive than the rest of our skin
so that we may caress women, eyes raised
on high to see the light, subtle scent to
breathe the soul of flowers, sinewy thighs
to grip the flanks of stallions and to fly
swift as thought without railway or engine,
delicate hands to draw over the long heads
of greyhounds, the velvet lines of cats,
and the gleaming shoulders of creatures
without virtue; he has given to us alone
the treble and glorious privilege of drinking
without being thirsty, of lighting tinder and
of making love at all times, which distinguishes
us from the brutes much more than
the habits of reading newspapers and manufacturing
maps.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
In this preface lives much of Anatole
France, his pure hedonism, his pagan love
of the beautiful, his entire lack of moral
purpose, counteracted by his consciousness
of the decent, the elegant thing. If he
believes, as I think he does, in honour, in
truth, courtesy, pity, service, it is not owing
to any harsh Protestant moral impulse, but
to a feeling that there are fine, clean things
revealed to us by some obscure Kantian,
categorical imperative; if he has a morality
at all it is the Ingersollian morality, that is
to say obligation perceived by a fine soul.
It is this inflames his style and links him
with his forbears, with Voltaire, with Renan,
with Molière, with the Italians of the sixteenth
century, with the amiable Latins,
with all the dead who loved the sunshine,
with the gay gods, and the warriors who, on
the way to the Elysian fields, did not turn
their backs upon wine, woman and song.
Not for him the sombre fates of duty, fear,
retribution; not for him malignant Jove
any more than malignant Jehovah. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
trenches in 1870 he read, not Sophocles, not
Æschylus, but Virgil. As Brotteaux went
to the guillotine he read Lucretius. For
him flowers and honey to lay upon the little
altars in Ausonian glades, and not the rapes
and arguments of ancient Greece.</p>

<p>A Latin by heredity, it follows that Anatole
France wields a style of singular purity.
His work is very polished and very condensed.
He uses as few words as possible
to embody his idea, and when he has made
his point, as, for instance, in stories such
as <i>The Procurator of Judæa</i>, he stops. His
desire is to knock out his reader, but he
does not, like Zola, then proceed to kneel
and to roll upon the prostrate figure, smothering
it and flattening it out under a vast bulk.
Anatole France never flounders; he does
not follow the man who did so much damage
to the literature of the nineteenth century
by piling up seventeen unessential details,
crowned, often by accident, with the essential
one. Selection is with him a habit, and
that is why Anatole France will never be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
confounded with the Zolas, the Sudermanns,
the William de Morgans. Without selection
he never could have achieved his delicate
little pictures of men and women, of their
passions stated in a paragraph; and still less
could he have built those strange animals
that he so loves. They are not always
philosophical animals like Riquet, the dog,
praying to man, his god; sometimes like
Miragoane, they are just intelligent, doggy
dogs, tail-wagging, greedy, apologetic, fulsome
dogs; at other times they are just
decorative beasts, especially the cats. For
Anatole France, like Théophile Gautier, like
Baudelaire, like Edgar Allan Poe, like almost
every artist who really is an artist, loves cats.
In his eyes the cat is as beautiful as woman.
Here is a scrap, which I feel I render inadequately,
devoted to sumptuous Hamilcar,
the Persian cat in the library:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Hamilcar, somnolent prince in the city
of books, watcher in the night! Thou dost
defend against vile rodents those things,
manuscript and printed, bought for the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
student by his modest hoard and his tireless
zeal. In this silent library which thy
military virtues protect, Hamilcar, sleep
languid as a sultana. For thou dost unite
in thy person the formidable air of a Tartar
warrior and the indolent grace of an Eastern
maid. Heroic and voluptuous Hamilcar,
sleep until the mice shall dance in the moonlight
before the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Acta Sanctorum</i> of the learned
Bollandists.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That is poetry, though, as I have suggested
before now, Anatole France, in spite
of his great love of the beautiful, is too
critical, too humorous, has too much detachment
to be written down a poet. He
loves the poets, notably Racine, and one
does not quite see why. But he is not a
poet because, I think, he is too remote;
the blood of the earth does not flow in his
veins, and it may be that if he were closely
questioned he would confess that he thinks
life very useful to literature. That is perhaps
why he tolerates it so well, why he can
smile at it, be serious and yet poke fun at it.
What a Fabian he would have made!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
One word as to his short stories. He is
in these more purely literary than in his
novels, presumably because in short stories
he has not space enough to get out of hand.
A few of them, such as <i>The Procurator of
Judæa</i>, and one or two of the revolutionary
tales in <i>Mother of Pearl</i>, are as good as any
French short stories, while <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Crainquebille</i> and
<i>Putois</i> reach the highest standard of de
Maupassant. Still, there is nothing to say
about them here: there is only one thing to
do, and that is to read them. There are
others, though, worth mentioning because,
together with their fine literary facture, they
carry the author’s ideas. For instance, in
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Sept Femmes de la Barbe Bleue</i>, Anatole
France sets to work to rehabilitate Bluebeard,
who, he contends, was henpecked and
deceived, though a very good fellow. This
is Anatole France’s little fling at rumour and
misrepresentation. It amuses him to trace
rumour to its sources, and I can imagine
as good a story as <i>Putois</i>, the gardener
who was invented and in the end nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
managed to exist, being written round the
story of the bombs in the German governess’s
bedroom that floated about during the
early part of the war. This is half mystical
and Anatole France is not a mystic, but
he has written several stories, to which I
refer a little later on, starting from which
it might be contended that if humanity
believed strongly enough in the bomb under
the bed the House of Commons might
eventually be blown up. Most of the short
stories, however, are merely novels <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in petto</i>;
some are mediæval, many Italian, and,
every now and then, they are modern and
ironic. Most of them, such as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Chemise</i>,
where operations become fashionable among
the Smart Set and where the professor asks
Society, “together a crowd and an élite,”
to his five-o’clock operation, “a charming
bit of ovariotomy,” to the accompaniment
of flowers, pretty frocks, music and ices,
are a criticism of life. This story recalls a
kind of life we know, for we are told that
“the professor’s elegance and grace were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
marvellous. The operation was taken for
the cinema.”</p>

<p>All through these stories runs his philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I love life which is earthy life, life as it
is, this dog’s life. I love it brutal, vile and
gross. I love it sordid, dirty, spoilt; I love
it stupid, imbecile and cruel; I love it in
its obscenity, in its infamy, with its violence,
its stinks, its corruptions and its infections....
On Sundays I go among the people, I
mix with the crowd that flows in the streets,
I plunge into groups of men, women and
children, which form round street-singers or
before the booths at fairs; I touch dirty
coats and greasy bodices; I breathe the
strong, warm scents of sweat, of hair, of
breaths. In this well of life I feel further
from death. Death: nothingness, that is an
infinite naught, and this naught envelops
us. Thence we come and hence we go;
we are always two nothingnesses as a shell
upon the waters. Nothingness is the impossible
and the assured; it is inconceivable
and it is.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A quotation such as this, taken in conjunction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
with the earlier quotation from the
preface of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mademoiselle de Maupin</i>, outlines
the man within the writer, and I need not
labour that the faith of Anatole France is the
faith of Epicurus, of Petronius Arbiter, of
Villon, of Rabelais, of Fielding. The whole
basis of him is sensuality, and I hate to say
this in a country such as England, where the
maypole has been cut down and Calvinism
reigns supreme, where sensuality, that once
whispered melodies into the ears of Pan and
hung garlands about the birch-trees, has
been hated and hunted until it had to take
refuge in the dirty talk of the public-house.</p>

<p>The sensuality of Anatole France is like
sap arising in the trees, like the moth circling
about the candle; it is joyous, frank, unashamed;
the world and all that is in it is
its toy. In this country it has become disgusting
to like good food; you must not
even talk of food, it is not done (and the
result is English food, the laughing-stock
of the universe). But listen to Anatole
France on food in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Histoire Comique</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Castelnaudary stew contains the
preserved thighs of geese, whitened beans,
bacon and a little sausage. To be good it
must have been cooked lengthily upon a
gentle fire. Clémence’s stew has been cooking
for twenty years. She puts into the
pan sometimes goose or bacon, sometimes
sausage or beans, but it is always the same
stew. The foundation endures; this ancient
and precious foundation gives the stew the
quality that in the pictures of old Venetian
masters you find in the women’s amber
flesh....”</p></blockquote>

<p>Here speaks the old Gaul who feasted on
roast meats, drank much hydromel, and as
he caressed the long droop of his fair
moustache cast a negligent, amiable glance
over his white-skinned, blue-eyed, black-haired
women. For the Gaul never forgot
women; he had anticipated Nietzsche by
two thousand years or so, and decided that
man was for war and woman for the recreation
of the warrior. This offends some of
us moderns, for the sensuality of the Frenchman,
so strong in Anatole France, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
sensuality of eating and drinking, of
burlesque, of gross stories, some of them
concerned with an apartment ignored in the
English household since the days of William
IV., lies thick over love.</p>

<p>It seems a pity to us that, in spite of all
his æstheticism, of his sense of beauty, it
should look as if Anatole France’s view of
love were contained in the famous phrase
of Alphonse Karr, or Gustave Droz, I forget
which:</p>

<p>“Love? A matter of skin.”</p>

<p>Well, love is not a matter of skin, at least
for us, and one would wish that Anatole
France should have found something ethereal,
symbolic in the union of man and woman.
I cannot explain what I mean: I detest the
word “spirituality,” and I hardly know
what I miss in this French view of love
that Anatole France holds, but I miss it.
This view is not exactly: “One woman
is as good as another,” but it certainly
is: “One woman is as good as another
if she is good-looking.” It is all flesh, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
æsthetics, which do redeem the flesh, do not
redeem it fully. The French heroine,
beloved of Anatole France’s heroes, is merely
Galatea animate; she is just the beautiful
woman descended from her pedestal at the
call of her chosen lover. Nothing calls to
him save the warm body that once was
beautiful marble, and he is content. <i>The
Red Lily</i> illustrates that idea. Here we
have two people, an unfaithful wife and her
lover. We are convinced by the suggestion
of extreme passion that these people have
reached the apogee of love. It is an unhappy,
tormented love, unrolling near the
Arno. It develops among a curious society
of literary people, is coloured by the usual
literary and artistic ideas of Anatole France.
Dechartre, the lover, is tormented because
his mistress had before him another lover;
he is not tormented by the existence of her
husband. His distress grows so intense
when he begins to suspect, quite wrongly,
that she is unfaithful to him with her first
lover, produces a strain so great, that their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
alliance breaks. Well, that is natural
enough, for, as Anatole France himself
remarks, man is possessive and woman is
not, because she has had to get used to
sharing, but it is difficult to understand at
first sight why Dechartre should be jealous
of another lover, and not jealous of a
husband. The answer, which is not evident
to everybody, is that the act of love is
symbolic and that a husband, taken as a
social base, is not comparable with a lover
taken for love.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> That is true enough, but
where fault must be found with the Gallic
view is that there is not a single phrase in
the book to show that Dechartre, represented
as in the throes of extreme love,
wishes to detach his mistress from her
husband. He never suggests that he wants
her to live with him always, that he wants
her society, her presence, the subtle delight
of hearing her walk in the room above. He
wants nothing but her body from four to six,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
twice a week: he is honourable, he is an
artist, but he is vile, he is a beast. Big
words these, but I have come to think that
if we differ at all from the brute it is by the
courage with which we face the consequences
of our deeds, by delicacies of feeling in which
caresses have no place, by something that
is more than elegance, that can maintain
love when sickness, ugliness appear and
æsthetics fall to the ground. There is not
in the works of Anatole France a line devoted
to love. Whether in <i>The Red Lily</i> or
in <i>The Merrie Tales of Jacques Tournebroche</i>,
or in any of the episodes, “love” is either
light and false and lying, or coarse and
brutal, or limited by the passing efflorescence
of a beauty that must die. He seems, like
every other Frenchman I can think of, unable
to understand what the Anglo-Saxon
means by idealism in love, by that idealism
so often made absurd by sentiment, but yet
delightful, and distinguished from the impulse
of a stag in rut.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>Relations between husband and wife may have
ceased, but this does not touch the argument.</p></div>

<p>And yet, strange to say, Anatole France<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
has written a few stories in which there is
a hint of mysticism. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Histoire Comique</i> is a
story of a haunting; in <i>Adrienne Buquet</i> there
is telepathy; in <i>The Graven Stone</i> a fatal
influence. There is <i>Putois</i> too, that famous
tale of a metaphysical conception in virtue
of which a man who was originally a joke
ends “like a mythological deity, in becoming
actual.” There is <i>A Daughter of Lilith</i>, a
tale of an immortal and fatal descendant
of the pre-Adamites. But those, I feel, are
intellectual exercises, and I suspect that they
spring from a passing idea of the author:
“I think I’ll write a mystical story; it
would be rather fun.”</p>

<p>The true Anatole France which hides
under the sentimental old gentlemen, so
cynical and so human, born so cold and to-day
so young, is the irreverent, jolly, blasphemous
Frenchman of the Middle Ages.
I have said this often and quoted much in
support because I want to make the English
understand what is so difficult for them to
understand: the Gaul and his joviality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Still I cannot resist quoting a story from
<i>Penguin Island</i>, which I am compelled to
condense:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was once a king and he had a
beautiful queen. At their court lived a
young monk, called Oddoul, who resisted
the devil and even woman. So the queen,
being woman and ambitious, attempted
his seduction. She called him into her
chamber, and he would not look upon her.
She held out her arms to him, and he fled.
Then in her fury, as he fled, she called the
guard and accused Oddoul of having
attempted to ravish her. He was thrown
into gaol. But in the night, as he waited
for the time to come when he would be led
out to be burnt alive, the cell was visited
by the angel of the Lord. And the angel
said: “What? Hast thou not done what
the Queen accuses thee of?” “No,” said
Oddoul. “Then,” cried the angel, “what
art thou doing here, idiot?” The angel
of the Lord opened the door and Oddoul
found himself driven out of the prison.
Scarcely had he gone down into the street
when a hand from high above emptied
upon his head a pailful of slops. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
he thought: “Mysterious are Thy designs,
O Lord, and Thy ways impenetrable.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not easy to understand Anatole
France because, like other men, he is neither
good nor evil; he is merely what he is.
I do not ask anyone to forgive him because
he loved much, nor to try and understand,
if that is the only way of forgiving him.
It is very much better to thank him for
having brought into the dusty old lumber-room
of stale ideas the breath of the new;
for having proclaimed pity in a world that
had slid into callousness; for having been
gay when the creeds bade us be sad. To
do that, if one can, is enough, for though one
may not understand him quite, the times
not yet being enlightened, one can offer
him the supreme tribute of loving him
without understanding.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
